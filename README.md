For COMP 248 Section (section U) â€“ Winter 2020

This program receives an integer from the user, calculates 
its "length" (the number of digits that form the integer) using integer division, 
and then prints out a reversed version of the integer using the modulus operator. 
Once the reversing process is completed, the user is given the option to quit 
the program or enter another integer.
